## Welcome to my GitHub Page

I'm currently studying Python, Django, JavaScript, Test-Driven Development, and many other cool subjects, with the aim of becoming a full stack Python/Django web developer.

I'll update this page with my bio, skills and portfolio projects in the near future.

Feel free to [mailto:raoul@raoulcapello.nl](contact me) in the meantime.
